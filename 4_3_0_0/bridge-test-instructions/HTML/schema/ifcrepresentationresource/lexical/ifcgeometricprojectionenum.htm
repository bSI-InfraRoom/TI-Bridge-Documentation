<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>GRAPH_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows an abstract, often 1D element representation, e.g. representing a wall by its axis line.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>SKETCH_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows an abstract, often 2D element representation, e.g. representing a wall by its two foot print edges, surpressing any inner layer representation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>MODEL_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows a full 3D element representation, e.g. representing a wall by its volumetric body.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>PLAN_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale, e.g. representing a wall by its two foot print edges and the edges of all inner layers. The projection is shown in ground view as seen from above.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>REFLECTED_PLAN_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale, e.g. representing a wall by its two foot print edges and the edges of all inner layers. The projection is shown in ground view as seen from below.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>SECTION_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale, e.g. representing a wall by its two inner/outer edges and the edges of all inner layers, if the element is cut by the section line.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>ELEVATION_VIEW</td><td><p>Geometric display representation that shows a full 2D element representation, the level of detail often depends on the target scale, e.g. representing a wall by its bounding edges if the element is within an elevation view.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>USERDEFINED</td><td><p>A user defined specification is given by the value of the <i>UserDefinedTargetView</i> attribute.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>NOTDEFINED</td><td><p>No specification given.</p>
