<h5 class="num">Semantic definitions at the type</h5>
<details open="open"><summary>Type definition</summary><p>This enumeration is used to identify the primary purpose of a duct fitting. This is a very basic categorization mechanism to generically identify the duct fitting type. Subcategories of duct fittings are not enumerated.</p>
<p class="spec-head">
Enumerated Item Definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BEND</strong>: A fitting with typically two ports used to change the direction of flow between connected elements.</li>
<li><strong>CONNECTOR</strong>: Connector fitting, typically used to join two ports together within a flow distribution system (e.g., a coupling used to join two duct segments).</li>
<li><strong>ENTRY</strong>: Entry fitting, typically unconnected at one port and connected to a flow distribution system at the other (e.g., an outside air duct system intake opening).</li>
<li><strong>EXIT</strong>: Exit fitting, typically unconnected at one port and connected to a flow distribution system at the other (e.g., an exhaust air discharge opening).</li>
<li><strong>JUNCTION</strong>: A fitting with typically more than two ports used to redistribute flow among the ports and/or to change the direction of flow between connected elements (e.g, tee, cross, wye, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>OBSTRUCTION</strong>: A fitting with typically two ports used to obstruct or restrict flow between the connected elements (e.g., screen, perforated plate, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>TRANSITION</strong>: A fitting with typically two ports having different shapes or sizes. Can also be used to change the direction of flow between connected elements.</li>
<li><strong>USERDEFINED</strong>: User-defined fitting.</li>
<li><strong>NOTDEFINED</strong>: Undefined fitting.</li>
